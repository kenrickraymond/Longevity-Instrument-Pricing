# Uncertainty in Pricing and Risk Measurement of Survivor Contracts

This repository contains the resources related to the article **[Uncertainty in Pricing and Risk Measurement of Survivor Contracts](https://doi.org/10.3390/risks13020035)**. The paper adopts a simulation-based approach to price and assess the risks associated with survivor contracts, which are indexed by the number of survivors from a reference population. Specifically, it focuses on the following survivor contracts:

- **Survival forwards (S-forwards)**
- **Survivor swaps (S-swaps)**

## Mortality Models

The following mortality models are considered in the analysis:

- **Lee–Carter model**
- **Renshaw–Haberman model**
- **Cairns–Blake–Dowd model**
- **M6 model**

## Premium Pricing Principles

The study uses eight different pricing premium principles to assess the survivor contracts:

- **Wang Transform**
- **Proportional Hazard Transform**
- **Dual Power Transform**
- **Gini Principle**
- **Exponential Transform**
- **Standard Deviation Principle**
- **Variance Principle**
- **Mean Absolute Deviation Principle**

## Risk Measurement

The thesis also analyzes the impact of the chosen mortality model and premium principle on the risk measures associated with survivor derivatives. A Monte Carlo approach is employed for this analysis. The risk measures considered include:

- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**
- **Expected Shortfall (ES)**
